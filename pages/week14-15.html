  <p><b class="black">Problem</b><br>
The world, today, is experiencing a global urbanization phenomenon. According to a report by the United Nations, in year 2050, 68% of the world population will live in urban areas. Humans, however, are not the only ones migrating to these cities. Studies show that, due to the presence of more resources and fewer predators, wild animals are largely also attracted to and find homes in cities. These new comers face a lot of problems in cities such as fragmented habitats, noise pollution, compressed territories and especially, the risk of harm from speeding cars. Yet, until today, very little attention or consideration is given to these issues when designing or planning cities. 
<br>
<br><b class="black">Process</b><br>
- Revisit the fundamentals that shaped our human-centric context <br>
- Move from anthropomorphic to nature-centric infrastructure<br>
- Explore design from a vantage point of animals: their behaviors, their sensory processes and their communication phenomena that govern their actions<br>
<br><b class="black">Guiding Questions</b><br>
For this, we start this project by asking the following questions:<br>
- How can we improve our cities and their infrastructure to accommodate for the needs, safety and behaviors of these newcomers?<br>
- How can we promote a healthy coexisting relationship between both, human and nonhuman animals?
<br><br>
<b class="black">Solution</b><br>
After several weeks of research and experiments, the resulted design is a traffic light system for both, geese and humans, that addresses the problem the new city dwellers face. Unlike a human-centric traffic system, this infrastructural system combines food, form, sound and light to guide geese and humans. 
<br><br>
<b class="black"> Phases</b><br>
Deploying the infrastructure on site happens in two separate phases: a training phase, where food is provided, and an instructing phase, where food is not present. During the first phase, passersby and pedestrians on sidewalks play a crucial role in training the geese to respond to sound. When humans pull the strings on the device, a “call” sound and food are released that attract geese to the device. As time goes by, the system becomes more automated. This device also aims to provide a multidimensional communication system that enhances the relationship between the two city dwellers. In its final stage, this device acts as a traffic system embedded with a machine vision camera that constantly checks for the presence of geese and vehicles. Once they are both found in the frame, the device would release a sound to alert the geese to move away and would start to blink a red light to alert the vehicles of the presence of geese. <br><br>
<b class="black">New Mindset</b><br>
By training one generation of geese or even one flock of geese, we hope that their behavior would be transmitted and passed along from one generation to the other or between different groups of geese. Also, with this project, we hope to achieve a new mindset in designing city infrastructure that prepares for and enhances the co-existence between animals - whether humans or non-humans - in an urban context. Wildlife and cities are no longer two separate worlds but are today merging into one.  For this, wildlife city dwellers should no longer be considered as a threat or a “parasite” in the city but must be welcomed, accustomed for and even designed for.

<p><b class="black">Week 1<br>
Focus:</b> Observing, Brainstorming & Ideating</p><br><br>

<p> <b class="black">Conclusions of Week 1: </b><br>
1. Geese could get used to an easy source of food<br>
2. Need for a more sustainable approach<br>
3. Test different ways of communicating a signal<br>
</p>

  <p><b class="black">Week 2</b></p>
    <p><b class="black">Focus: </b>Exploring more natural ways of communication</p>
  <p>Based on studies we found about repelling or attracting geese, we decided to explore 3 different forms of communication.<br><br>
    1. Eye spot<br>
    2. Reflective Surface<br>
    3. Sound: Sounds we used were from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.<br></p><br>
   <div class="iframe-container">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/338910777" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
  <br><br>
<p>These initial experiments proved to us that geese are not attracted or repelled by any of these systems. We believe that these systems might work in more rural areas, however, for city geese, these systems proved to be inefficient. </p>
<p><b class="black">Conclusion of Week 2:</b><br></p> 
 <p>1. Sound test is successful and effective.<br>
 2. Geese are confused about the source of the sound.<br> 
3. Need for a recognizable visual form for the sound.</p>
<p>Also, a problem we found is that, first, we were using the sounds randomly and these geese responded to the aggressive sounds as well as to the mating sounds. We believe the choice of sounds must be carefully chosen and tested. </p>

  <p><b class="black">Week 3</b><p>
    <p><b class="black"> Focus:</b> Testing Form</p>
    <p> The form we decided to test is the form of a neck. Geese's necks are a very important tool of communication between geese. Each position transmits a certain meaning, reflects a certain state and sends a certain signal to other geese around. 
      <br><br>To test this, we did a quick prototype out of a foam tube and a carton box. We think that this shape vaguely resembles the color and shape of the geese. The aim was mainly to test the geese's response to the neck. </p><br><br>

    <p> <b class="black">Conclusion of Week 3:</b></p> 

<p>1. People are attracted by form & sound and are curious to play with the device<br>
2. Geese are attracted by sound but showed no interest in interacting with the device<br></p>

      <p><b class="black"> Week 4</p>
      <p>Focus:</b> Combining Sound & Form for Geese & Humans</p>
      <p> After performing these tests, we concluded that a combination of form, food and sound is needed to design our traffic system.</p><br><br>

        <p> <b class="black">Conclusion of Week 4:</b></p> 
       <p><b class="black">1. Phases:</b> <br>Installing this project in two separate stages and as two different devices with different functions helps us achieve the sustainability, longevity and resiliency of such a system in an urban context.
<br><br>
<b class="black">2. Generalization:</b><br>
Although this device is made specifically for geese, with a few modifications, it could also be used for several other animals living in cities that are at risk of harm while wondering in a city’s human-centric streets. <br><br>


<b class="black">3. Ultimate Goals:</b><br>
A goal of this project is to replace the traffic system and turn it into a more inclusive system for both human and nonhuman city dwellers. However, the ultimate goal is to achieve a new mindset in designing city infrastructure that prepares for and enhances the co-existence between animals 
- whether humans or non-humans - in an urban context.
