<p> <b>After our week 1-4 research, we realized that the problems that exist with our first prototype and the main issues we need to address are the following:<br>
  1. Geese can get used to an easy food source<br>
  2. We need a more sustainable approach<br>
  3. We need to find different/ more natural ways of communicating a signal.<br>
</p>
                      <img src="../images/inse1.jpg" alt="oops" style="width:100%"><br><br>

  <p><b class="black">Week 2</b></p>
    <p><b>Focus: </b>Exploring more natural ways of communication</p>
  <p>We decided to work on repel vs. attract systems. We focused on 3 systems:<br>
    1. Eye spot<br>
    2. Reflective Surface<br>
    3. Sound<br></p>

                      <img src="../images/inse1.jpg" alt="oops" style="width:100%"><br><br>
                      <img src="../images/inse1.jpg" alt="oops" style="width:100%"><br><br>
<p>These initial experiments proved to us that geese are not attracted or repelled by any of these systems. We believe that these systems might work in more rural areas, however, for city geese, these systems proved to be unefficient. </p>
<p> We also found that the only thing that lures these geese is food.</p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/329404597" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p> Our next step is to test sound. Sounds we used were from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. </p>
<img src="../images/inse1.jpg" alt="oops" style="width:100%"><br><br>
<img src="../images/inse1.jpg" alt="oops" style="width:100%"><br><br>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/329404597" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p> Using sound seemed to be very effective and we got a lot of responses from these geese. The problem we found first is that we were using the sounds randomly and these geese responded to the aggressive sounds as well as to the mating sounds.</p>
<p> Hence, for the sound tests:<br>
  1. We got a response<br>
  2. Geese were alert<br>
  3. Geese cannot detect sound source<br>
  <p><b>Week 3</b><p>
    <p> Focus: Testing Form</p>
    <p>Moving forward, we found that we should test form. Since geese were able to be alerted by sound but seemed puzzled as to where the sound is coming from, we decided to test some forms.</p>
    <p> The form we decided to test is the neck of the geese. Geese' necks are a very important tool of communication between geese. Each position can be associated to a certain meaning, reflects the state of a certain geese and sends a certain signal to other geese around.</p>
    <img src="../images/inse1.jpg" alt="oops" style="width:100%"><br><br>
    <p> Form Testing</p>
    <p> We did a very quick prototype out of a foam tube and a carton box and we covered it with white napkins. We think that this shape vaguely resembles the color of shape of the geese. The aim was mainly to test the geese's response to the neck. </p>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/329404597" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/329404597" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p> The geese did not seem to respond to the shape. we think that they were afraid of the shape as well since it's resting state was the aggressive state. For this, we tried hiding it and testing the location of the sound instead.</p>
     <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/329404597" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/329404597" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p> With this, we found out that we were able to create a communication tool between geese in different zones. Geese were following the sound source and moving with the sound from left to right and from the lawns to the waters. Since there were 2 flocks of geese, one in the water and one on the lawns, using a sound between them while standing closer to the geese on land, we were able to create a communication tool between the two flocks, resulting in all the geese on the lawn moving to the water.</p>
<p>Another Finding</p>
<p> Another finding we found is that the neck device was very interesting for kids. Kids seemed to stand from a certain distance and watch us perform the experiment. We told them to come close and play with it. Both parents and children seemed interested.

    <p>Summary of Week 3</p>
    <p> Form Test<br>
      1. Geese did not respond to form<br>
      2. Geese were attracted by sound only<br>
      3.People, especially kids, were attracte by form<br></p>
      <p> Week 4</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Combining Sound & Form for Geese & Humans</p>
      <p> After these tests and our findings, for this week, we decided to combine both sound and form for both geese and human. </p>
    <p> TO DO:


     Main Purpose: 
Design a device whose ultimate goal is to establish 
a harmonious living between geese and humans in an urban context.



Goals:
To help both city dwellers co-exist, For better communication between geese and humans,  To keep geese safe,  Educate human city dwellers about geese.  </p>
