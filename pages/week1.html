  <p>Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics or traits to non-human entities such as Gods, animals or objects. As an architect, such attributions seem so common and natural to me that I don’t notice myself or others around me doing them. Now that I forced myself to think about it as two separate things, I realized that this relationship between architecture and anthropomorphism has a long and extensive history. It dates back to way long ago where it first appeared as a comparison between architecture and the human body in the works of Vitruvius, The Ten Books on Architecture, written in the time of Augustus. Ever since then, anthropomorphism became a dominant concept in architecture and human attributes and behaviors became more and more applied to buildings and physical space in a very common manner.<br><br><br></p>

<p>I think anthropomorphism is much needed in architecture and makes this field much richer. Anthropomorphism has helped me become a better architect and designer in so many ways. In fact, and I quote from the reading:<i>“Anthropomorphic metaphors are attempts to make sense of the world around us: without reference to human experience, as Mary Midgley put it, there is no human understanding.”</i> As an architect, we design for humans, hence, relating to humans is a must. Anthropomorphism has brought architecture closer to terms and concepts that I can relate to and understand, whether it be through metaphors about proportions, form, constituents or even behavior.</p> <br><br>
<p class="black"><b>Proportion:</b></p>
<p>Humans have attributed direct measurement techniques to architecture in relation to the human body.<br><br>
The first and most famous example is the Vitruvian Man, created by Leonardo da Vinci based on notes of the architect Vitruvius Pollio. The drawing depicts a male figure inscribed in a circle and a square and resembles ideal human proportions with geometry, proportions which were widely the principal source of measurement for the classical orders of architecture. <br>
In the design of cathedrals, humans believed that our proportions are divine proportions, created by God and thus, whatever we create, must be in the same proportions. For this, plans of cathedrals were all in relation to these specific ratios and scales. <br><br></p>

<br><br><br>


<p class="black"><b>Form:</b></p>
<p>In more contemporary examples, approach to anthropomorphism became more in relation to the form rather than the proportions merely. Architects started using words such as dancing, climbing, falling, embracing to describe how a could look and “behave”. <br><br>
A famous example would be the Dancing House by Frank Gehry in Prague. In fact, this building is also referred to as “The Fred and Ginger Building” as it vaguely resembles the 1930’s Hollywood dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers. Apart from attributing verbs such as dancing to it, it is also viewed as a depiction of specific people. </p><br><br>

<br><br><br>
<p><b class="black">Constituents:</b></p>
<p>The human body does much more than just provide proportions to architecture. Architecture can be in fact considered as a reflection of the human body, both, in terms of its systems and its proportions. Both buildings and systems are comprised of systems that keep them “alive”: a skeletal system in humans resembles a structural system in buildings, circulatory systems of blood and other fluids in bodies resemble water, electricity and sewage systems in buildings and finally, human skin resembles a building’s facade. Within each element more subcategories can be delved into in detail to make this metaphor even stronger where the windows of a building can be regarded as the nose, eyes and mouth of the building etc. <br><br><br></p>


<p><b class="black">Behavior:</b></p>
<p>Finally, apart from physical attributes, behavior can also be attributed to buildings. A building is believed to “respond” to certain criteria, be “inviting” enough for people, to “reach out” to something, to “lean on or towards” a certain thing etc.<br><br>
As an example, just by a very quick search, I extracted this small paragraph from Rem Koolhaas’s website about a project called Audrey Irmas Pavilion to illustrate this idea. <br></p>

<br><br><br>

<p>Personally, I have always, both, unconsciously and consciously, related so much to the human body in my designs, whether as an architect or a creative technologist. Yet, after reading this article, I realized that I have never thought of it in depth as it was so deeply integrated into my thinking and my work. I have also realized that, unlike in regard to architecture, when it comes to living things, anthropomorphism diverts into different types: animal centric and anthropocentric. To me, it all fell under one title. Hence, in this course I am excited to explore this new definition and find a balance between animal centric and anthropocentric anthropomorphism when studying other animals.
