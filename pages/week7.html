<p> <b class="black">Our Motivation</b><br>
While choosing an animal, my teammates, Jerry and Zihao, and I, agreed that we are all really interested in exploring the relationship between the city, its infrastructure and the wild animals who live in it. Driven by this, we decided to choose an animal that we can actually go and observe in an urban context around the city to study its behavior and actions in this specific environment.<br><br>
After researching about NYC’s Urban Wildlife, we finally chose to observe the Canada Goose. <br><br>

To do so, our first step was to actually find this animal in New York. We found out that various kinds of migrating sea birds can be found in Winter in Newport in New Jersey and hence, we decided to go there. These birds live in the summer summer in the remote wilderness of Alaska and Canada and spend winter in the warmer Hudson River in and around Newport. The open water and beaches area provide abundant resources for these birds to live and forage in. While searching, we found a flock of Canada Goose by the riverbank near the Newport Path station, and chose them as our object of observation.<br><br>
 These geese were everywhere, on the rocks by the sea, on the sidewalk, on lawns, on streets etc. And passersby, especially those with children, stopped and either took pictures of these geese or interacted with them in some way or the other. 
<br><br>

<br>



<br><br><br>
We spent around 2 hours observing the geese, noting their behavior, videotaping them, analyzing people’s interactions with them, studying their actions on the different “zones” in our chosen “site” and coming up with conclusions based on these observations. 
<br><br>

Below is a table that sums up our observations: (AEIOU Table)
<br><br>

<br><br><br>
For our behavioral mapping, each one of us followed one goose and noted down its behavior, its actions and its path.

<br><br><br><br>
<b class="black">Brainstorming </b><br>
After observing, we headed to the nearest Starbucks, sat near the windows to keep on observing the geese and started brainstorming there.
<br><br>
Questions we asked (Guiding Questions):<br>
- With the presence of these newcomers today in an urban context, what are some problems they face with this change of environment and what are some problems caused by them in these cities?<br>
- With more and more animals living in cities and with the change of cities towards smart infrastructure, what are some changes we could do to help these animals better get accustomed to the life in cities? <br>
- With all this in mind, how do we design infrastructure with animals as the user rather than humans?<br><br>


    <img src="../images/brainstorm1.jpg" style="width:100%; display: inline; margin: auto;"><br>
<br>
<br><br><br>
While observing these geese through the window, we noticed two funny phenomena. <br><br>
- Runners on the sidewalk always avoided and changed their path because of these geese. <br>
- These geese always caused traffic when they crossed the street. <br>
- Sometimes, cars would stop too sudden as they did not see the geese passing.<br> 
- Also, geese as well would sometimes be alarmed by a car passing by and risk getting hurt.<br><br>
We assumed that this point of interaction on the streets between geese and cars could be very dangerous for both, the geese and the cars and is an important point to tackle.

<br><br><br><br><br>
<b class="black">Our Proposal</b><br>
Our design proposal is an infrastructural “traffic X system” for geese - the X would refer to the function that we give this device that would trigger a response in geese. The design technically would act as a “signal” system that would guide the geese to act accordingly. For this proposal, we sketched out three ideas and tested on site one of them. <br><br>


<br><br><br>



<b class="black"> For Streets:<br></b>
Idea 1: Traffic Feeder System<br>

<b> Idea 2: Traffic “Wing” System</b><br>
  <img src="../images/sketch3.png" style="width:100%; display: block; margin: auto;"><br><br>
 <br><br>
<b class="black">For sidewalks: <br></b>
Idea 3: Runner “Move Away” System<br><br>
